Deeply review existing change.

Try to find opportunities for DRY. i.e. where you can push the net balance of code additions as low as possible while simultaneously improving readability and behavior.

Do not venture into changes beyond the scope of the PR.

Also, make sure the body and title of the PR are concise and reflect the
totality of the changes. Take note of recent commits on the base branch for
the correct style of PR title.
